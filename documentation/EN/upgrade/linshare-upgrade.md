###Deployment of the archive
</a>

To deploy the archive you downloaded and upgrade your __LinShare core__ version, you must rename it and copy it in your tomcat webapps repository :

[root@localhost ~]$ cp linshare-core-{VERSION}.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/linshare.war

###Database Upgrade
</a>

> Note :

  - This is an postgres upgrade exemple. It is the same for mysql.

If you are doing an upgrade to a minor version (i.e from 1.X to 1.Y), you will need to upgrade your database.

You have then to update your database as the following :

```
[root@localhost ~]$ cd linshare.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/
[root@localhost ~]$ unzip -c linshare.war WEB-INF/classes/sql/postgresql/Migration_<your-actual-version>_to_<the-next-version>.sql | psql -U linshare -W -d linshare
```

> Note :

  - If you are upgrading for example from the 1.6.0 to the 1.9.0, you must run the following scripts :
    * Migration_1.6.0_to_1.7.0.sql
    * Migration_1.7.0_to_1.8.0.sql
    * Migration_1.8.0_to_1.9.0.sql

> Note :
  - you must read the following file which contains some particularities about each migration : https://github.com/linagora/linshare-core/blob/master/UPGRADE.md
